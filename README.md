This chrome extension bypasses the "This content is unavailable try again later" message that youtube gives when it detects an adblocker.

**"This content is unavailable. Try again later."**

This lightweight Chrome extension automatically reloads YouTube video pages when the player fails to load correctly. It helps recover from the common YouTube bug where videos show the error:
